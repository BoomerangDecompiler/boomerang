# OVERVIEW:    New Jersey Machine Code Toolkit specification file for the

# $Revision$
#  April 01 - Simon: Initial revision
# 01 May 01 - Simon: Fixed a problem with arith_imm's (bit numbers wrong?)
# 04 May 01 - Mike: Merged two .spec files
# 07 May 01 - Mike: Split [LD|ST]Wlm into lma and lmb depending on sign of im14
# 08 May 01 - Mike: New constructor for [LD|ST]Wlm (ldispa16m[ab]_addr
# 08 May 01 - Cristina: Cross-referenced table letters from Appendix C, 
#				PA-RISC 2.0 Architecture book
# 18 Jun 01 - Mike: Added Floating Point instuctions
# 26 Jun 01 - Mike: Changed some mnemonics from 2.0 to 1.1 form
# 27 Jun 01 - Mike: Major rewrite of integer loads and stores, in preparation
#               for "lambdas" in SSL file
# 19 Jul 01 - Simon: Reorganised loads and stores (again) and grouped addresses for both.


# The convention for bit fields is aann_mm, where aa briefly describes the
# field, nn is the field length in bits, and mm is the starting bit number
# (in HP numbering, i.e. 0 at the left)
# Example: In the HP book, the im11 field of ADDI extends from bits 21 to 31.
# The sign bit is separated (always in bit 31), so we name the field from bits
# 21 to 30 as im10_21 (10 bits starting at 21)

# instruction fields go [0..31] left-->right
bit 0 is most significant
